<h1>1. TEA TREE OIL</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
	Tea tree oil is a natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, which means that it might kill P. acnes, the bacteria that causes acne. Tea tree oil's anti-inflammatory properties mean that it can also reduce the swelling and redness of pimples. A 2015 review study looked at the existing	evidence for tea tree oil and acne. The researchers found that tea tree oil products can reduce the number of acne sores in people with mild to moderate acne. This study suggested that tea tree oil may work as well as 5 percent benzoyl peroxide, which is a common over-the-counter (OTC) acne medication.
	<br /><br />
	How to use tea tree oil:<br />
	People can apply tea tree extract to their acne in creams, gels, or essential oils. If people use essential oils, always dilute them in a carrier oil first.

<h1>2. ALOE VERA</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
	Aloe vera is a natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, meaning it may reduce the appearance of acne and prevent acne breakouts. Aloe vera contains lots of water and is an excellent moisturizer, so it is especially suitable for people who get dry skin from other anti-acne products. In a 2014 study, researchers gave people with mild to moderate acne aloe vera gel and tretinoin cream, which is a common OTC acne remedy, to use	for 8 weeks. The participants reported a significant improvement in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne compared to people who used just tretinoin gel.
	<br /><br />
	How to use aloe vera gel:<br />
	Try cleaning the acne sores and then applying a thin layer of cream or gel with at least 10 percent aloe vera content. Otherwise, people can moisturize with gels or creams that contain aloe vera.

<h1>4. GARLIC</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;"> 
	Many traditional medicine practitioners use garlic to treat infections and boost the body's ability to fight germs and infections. Garlic contains organo-sulfur compounds, which have natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Organosulfur compounds can also help to boost the immune system, which helps the body fight infections.
	<br /><br />
	How to use garlic:<br />
	To fight the inflammation and infections caused by acne, people can add more garlic to their diet. Some people chew whole garlic cloves, rub it on toast, or make it into a hot drink. People can also buy garlic powders or capsules from most grocery stores and natural health stores.
