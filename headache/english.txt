<h1>1. WATER</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
Drinking enough water may help prevent headaches or reduce their severity. Dehydration can be an underlying cause of many simple headaches.
It may also alter how a person feels, acts, or thinks. As a study in the journal Antioxidants notes, even slight dehydration may alter how
people think and function, making them feel worse, with or without a headache. Water may help make someone in this situation feel better,
although some studies are more cautious. A critical reading of one study published in the Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice
noted that drinking water did not reduce how long people had their headaches, but it did make them subjectively feel better. Staying hydrated
may be as simple as carrying a water bottle around and sipping on it throughout the day. Eating foods high in liquid, such as fruits, smoothies,
or soups, may also improve hydration.

<h1>2. WARM / COLD COMPRESS</h1>$

<h3>WARM COMPRESS :</h3>
In other cases, such as with a tension headache where the muscles are too tight, a warm compress may help relax these muscles and bring relief.
A warm compress could be as simple as a heated towel. People may be able to get the same effect from a tepid shower or bath.
<h3>COLD COMPRESS :</h3>
A cold compress may be a simple headache solution that many people have on hand. Applying an ice pack or another cold item to the head or neck
may help constrict the blood vessels and reduce inflammation in the area. Doing so could temporarily relieve headache pain. A study in Hawai'i
Journal of Medicine & Public Health found that applying ice packs to the neck for 30 minutes significantly reduced pain in people with migraines.

<h1>3. CAFFEINE</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;"> 
Drinking a beverage with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or soda, may sometimes help ease a headache. Some pain medications designed for headaches
include caffeine, as the compound may improve their effectiveness. As a review published in the Journal of Headache and Pain notes, caffeine by
itself may help reduce symptoms of a tension headache or migraine. Caffeine tends to relax the blood vessels, which may support circulation and
ease tension.

<h1>4. TRY SOME HERBAL TEA</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;"> 
Herbal tea may be a useful way to add water to the diet while also enjoying the benefits of other natural compounds. For instance, ginger tea
may help with a migraine. One 2013 study found that ginger powder had similar effects to a common medication for reducing migraines. A simple
tea of warm water and ginger powder may help with symptoms. Other potentially calming teas include herbs such as peppermint, chamomile, and
lavender.
