<h1>1. GARGLING</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
This old-school remedy can ease a sore throat, which is often one of the first symptoms of a cold. People can choose from a variety of saltwater
gargle recipes, including gargling with 1 teaspoon of salt mixed in a cup of warm water. Another option is gargling with warm water that is
mixed with half a teaspoon of lemon juice and honey. With any gargling solutions, people should be sure that the water is not too hot, which
can lead to burns.

<h1>2. STEAM</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
Breathing in steam from a hot shower may decrease nasal congestion and sinus pressure, at least temporarily. An alternative to a hot shower is
filling a pot with boiling water, placing a towel over the head and breathing in the steam. Steam soothes the tissues of the nose and throat
and to make steam inhalation even more effective, people can consider adding eucalyptus, which is an essential oil. The National Association
for Holistic Aromatherapy suggest adding 3 to 7 drops of eucalyptus oil to boiling water and inhaling the steam through the nose. A range of
eucalyptus oils is available for purchase. People should close the eyes to avoid irritation.

<h1>3. HONEY </h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
A research study published in Pediatrics suggested that giving honey to children before bedtime helped decrease nighttime cold. Honey should
not be given to babies under the age of 1, however, because it contains botulinum spores. If the spores grow in a baby's immature digestive
tract, they can make a baby sick.

<h1>4. SIPPING FLUIDS</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;"> 
Drinking plenty of fluids can help prevent dehydration and may thin mucus. Water is the best bet when it comes to staying well hydrated.
Other liquids such as juice are also acceptable. Tea with lemon and honey and other hot drinks may help break up congestion and ease a
sore throat. Hot soup, especially spicy soups, may promote nasal drainage and make breathing easier. People who have a cold should avoid
alcohol, which can contribute to dehydration.
