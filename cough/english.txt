<h1>1. SALT WATER GARGLE</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">This simple remedy is one of the most effective for treating a sore throat and wet cough. Salt water reduces phlegm and mucus in the back of               the throat which can lessen the need to cough. Stir half a teaspoon of salt into a cup of warm water until it dissolves. Allow the solution
                to cool slightly before using it to gargle. Let the mixture sit at the back of the throat for a few moments before spitting it out. Gargle
                with salt water several times each day until the cough improves. Avoid giving salt water to younger children as they may not be able to
                gargle properly, and swallowing salt water can be dangerous.

<h1>2. MARSMELLOW ROOT</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
                    Marshmallow root is an herb that has a long history of use as a treatment for coughs and sore throats. The herb can ease irritation resulting
              from coughing because of its high mucilage content. Mucilage is a thick, gluey substance that coats the throat. One small study revealed that
              an herbal cough syrup containing marshmallow root, along with thyme and ivy, effectively relieved coughs resulting from common colds and
              respiratory tract infections. After 12 days of taking the syrup, 90 percent of the participants rated its effectiveness as good or very good.
              Marshmallow root is also available as a dried herb or a bagged tea. Add hot water to either and then drink it immediately or allow it to cool
              first. The longer the marshmallow root steeps in the water, the more mucilage will be in the drink. Side effects can include stomach upset,
              but it may be possible to counter this by drinking extra fluids. Marshmallow root is available to purchase in health stores.

<h1>3. HONEY TEA</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
                    A study on treatments for nighttime coughing in children compared dark honey with the cough-suppressing medication dextromethorphan and with no
              treatment. The researchers reported that honey provided the most significant relief from coughing, followed by dextromethorphan. Although the
              benefits of honey over dextromethorphan were small, parents rated honey most favorably of all three interventions. To use honey to treat a cough,
              mix 2 teaspoons (tsp) with warm water or an herbal tea. Drink this mixture once or twice a day. Do not give honey to children under 1 year of age.

<h1>4. GINGER</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;"> 
                    Ginger may ease a dry or asthmatic cough, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. It may also relieve nausea and pain. One study suggests that
              some anti-inflammatory compounds in ginger can relax membranes in the airways, which could reduce coughing. The researchers mainly studied the
              effects of ginger on human cells and animals, so more research is necessary. Brew up a soothing ginger tea by adding 20â€“40 grams (g) of fresh
              ginger slices to a cup of hot water. Allow to steep for a few minutes before drinking. Add honey or lemon juice to improve the taste and further
              soothe a cough. Be aware that, in some cases, ginger tea can cause stomach upset or heartburn.
