### AJAX PATTERN
* Multi-Stage Download : Our application provides remedies that are  tailored mainly by text, images, videos, etc.Whenever user searches for remedies, application takes time to download entire page due to non-textual content. To overcome this issue, we use Multi-Stage Download and divide content into multiple stages, so that faster and important data like text will arrive first compared to the rest. Since, most of the content for the remedies are in textual format, it’ll be easier to respond with text rather than images, videos, etc.
* Caching : Everytime when user looks for remedy, he/she can cache the result so that unnecessary download of same content can be prevented. Since the content(remedies, issues, etc) of our application is static most of the time, it’ll be appropriate to cache the pages and provide faster response to the users.


### INTELLIGENCE - LANGUAGE TRANSLATION
Our website supports three different languages, mainly – English, Hindi & Kannada. Allows User to view the content of the webpage in any language of their choice. Translation is achieved using Google’s  Translation API which dynamically translate text between the language pairs.
