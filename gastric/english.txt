<h1>1. DRINK TEA</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
Some herbal teas may aid digestion and reduce gas pain fast. The most effective include teas made from:
anise
chamomile
ginger
peppermint
Anise acts as a mild laxative and should be avoided if diarrhea accompanies gas. However, it can be helpful if constipation is responsible
for trapped gas.

<h1>2. SNACK ON FENNEL SEEDS</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
Fennel is an age-old solution for trapped wind. Chewing on a teaspoon of the seeds is a popular natural remedy. However, anyone pregnant or
breast-feeding should probably avoid doing so, due to conflicting reports concerning safety.

<h1>3. TAKE PEPPERMINT SUPPLEMENTS</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;">
Peppermint oil capsules have long been taken to resolve issues like bloating, constipation, and trapped gas. Some research supports the use
of peppermint for these symptoms. Always choose enteric-coated capsules. Uncoated capsules may dissolve too quickly in the digestive tract,
which can lead to heartburn. Peppermint inhibits the absorption of iron, so these capsules should not be taken with iron supplements or by
people who have anemia.

<h1>4. CLOVE OIL</h1>$
<p style="font-family: courier;"> 
Clove oil has traditionally been used to treat digestive complaints, including bloating, gas, and indigestion. It may also have
ulcer-fighting properties. Consuming clove oil after meals can increase digestive enzymes and reduce the amount of gas in the intestines.
